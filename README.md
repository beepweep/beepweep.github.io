# BeepWeep Ventures

**A haven for the 10x builders, the thinkers, the quiet architects of wealth.**

This is the official website for BeepWeep Ventures, featuring a bold **Neo-Brutalist** design aesthetic that reflects our commitment to substance over status.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The site utilizes a "Neo-Brutalist" design language characterized by:
*   **High Contrast**: Stark black and white palette with "International Orange" and "Hyper Blue" accents.
*   **Bold Typography**: Massive, uppercase headings using `Space Grotesk`.
*   **Hard UI Elements**: Thick 3px borders, hard offset shadows, and tactile hover states.
*   **Raw Textures**: Subtle dot grid backgrounds and technical decorative elements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and SEO.
*   **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and keyframe animations. No frameworks were used—just pure, raw CSS.
*   **JavaScript**: Minimal vanilla JS for the cookie consent banner.
