# BeepWeep Ventures

> **"A haven for the 10x builders, the thinkers, the quiet architects of wealth."**

Welcome to the digital home of **BeepWeep Ventures**. We are a venture capital firm that attracts those who solve problems with precision, not ego. We chase outcomes, not optics. Here, status takes a back seat to substance.

## 👥 The Architects

**Madhur Satija** - CEO (Chief Execution Officer)
*Full stack operator and generalist. A builder who turned curiosity into ventures across blockchain, fintech, and beyond. He architects systems that compound. From news media to Web3, his path has been deliberate: solve real problems, build with precision, scale with purpose. No fluff. Just execution.*

**Abhishek Kaushik** - CTO (Chief Troubleshooting Officer)
*Technical leader ensuring systems run smoothly and problems get solved.*

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: Neo-Brutalism

This website embodies our core philosophy: **Substance over Status**.

We chose a **Neo-Brutalist** aesthetic to reflect this: raw, unpolished, and unapologetically bold.
*   **High Contrast**: Stark black and white with "International Orange" (#ff4d00) and "Hyper Blue" (#0055ff) accents.
*   **Typography**: Massive, uppercase `Space Grotesk` headings that demand attention.
*   **UI Elements**: Thick 3px borders, hard offset shadows, and tactile interactions.
*   **Texture**: A subtle dot grid background representing the technical precision of our work.
*   **Dark Mode**: Fully functional light/dark theme toggle with system preference detection.
